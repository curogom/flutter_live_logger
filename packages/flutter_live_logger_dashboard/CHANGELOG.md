#### Usage Guidelines

- **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This package is designed for **development use only**
- **Installation**: Add to `dev_dependencies` section in your `pubspec.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Real-time log monitoring and debugging during development
- **Not for production**: Should not be included in production app builds

### Development Workflow

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_live_logger_dashboard: ^0.2.0+1
```

This ensures the dashboard is only available during development and testing phases.

**Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed `fl_chart` version compatibility issue by downgrading from 1.0.0 to 0.68.0
- Resolved Dart SDK version conflicts (now compatible with Dart 3.3.4+)
- Fixed dependency resolution failures in CI/CD environments

**Compatibility:**

- Minimum Flutter version: 3.22.0 (balanced modern features with broad compatibility)
- Minimum Dart SDK version: 3.5.0 (supports current development environments)
- Works with Flutter 3.22+ and Dart 3.5+

**Breaking Changes:**

- Minimum Flutter version increased to 3.24.0 (from 3.19.0)
- Minimum Dart SDK version increased to 3.6.0 (from 3.3.0)

**Enhancements:**

- Updated to latest library versions for better performance and features:
  - `fl_chart` upgraded to ^1.0.0 (latest chart library with new features)
  - `shelf_web_socket` upgraded to ^3.0.0 (improved WebSocket performance)
  - Full compatibility with modern Flutter/Dart ecosystem

**Rationale:**

- Dashboard is a development tool supporting current Flutter versions
- Better pub.dev scores with up-to-date dependencies
- Balanced approach between modern features and compatibility

**Migration Guide:**

- Update your Flutter to 3.24.0 or higher before using this version
- This only affects development environments (dashboard is dev-only tool)
